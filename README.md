# Finger Firmware

Firmware scaffold for the HAND ERC robotic finger electronics controller.

This project is intentionally simple for fast onboarding:

- CMake + Ninja build
- ARM GCC toolchain
- One NUCLEO-G431KB target
- Flat module folders for app, comms, and sensors
- No IDE-specific build requirement

## Quick Start

Run the setup helper first:

```sh
./tools/setup.sh
```

The script detects your OS, checks for CMake, Ninja, the ARM GCC toolchain, and
ST command-line tools, then installs what it can through a supported package
manager. If an ST tool needs a manual installer, the script prints the next
steps and reruns the final environment check.

Useful setup variants:

```sh
./tools/setup.sh --check-only
./tools/setup.sh --yes
```

Manual build requirements, if you prefer not to use the script:

- CMake
- Ninja
- `arm-none-eabi-gcc`
- `arm-none-eabi-objcopy`
- `arm-none-eabi-size`

Additional ST tools:

- [STM32CubeCLT](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeclt.html), recommended for full flash/debug support because it includes STM32CubeProgrammer, the ST-LINK GDB server, GDB, and SVD files
- [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html), smaller flash-only alternative if you do not need VS Code debugging

Then run:

```sh
./tools/check_env.sh
cmake --preset nucleo-debug
cmake --build --preset nucleo-debug
```

To flash a connected NUCLEO-G431KB:

```sh
cmake --build --preset nucleo-debug --target flash
```

## UART Logging

The firmware initializes USART2 at `115200 8N1` and writes a boot banner plus a
one-second heartbeat. The heartbeat includes milliseconds, main-loop count, I2C
sensor status, IMU `WHO_AM_I`, and the latest acceleration sample when valid.

On the NUCLEO-G431KB target this is intended for the ST-LINK virtual COM port
using USART2 on PA2/PA3. If you are using a different board revision, custom
wiring, or changed solder bridges, verify the USART2 virtual COM routing in the
board schematic.

To view logs from a terminal, use the helper script:

```sh
./tools/serial_monitor.sh
```

The script finds likely USB serial ports and opens the first match. It uses
`screen` underneath for reliable serial handling, but the foreground command
closes with `Ctrl-C`. To list candidates without opening one:

```sh
./tools/serial_monitor.sh --list
```

To choose a specific port:

```sh
./tools/serial_monitor.sh --port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

If the port is busy, the script prints the process holding it. Close that
program, or explicitly ask the script to kill it:

```sh
./tools/serial_monitor.sh --kill-busy
```

For compatibility with older workflows, the helper can also open the port with
`screen`:

```sh
./tools/serial_monitor.sh --screen
```

In `--screen` mode, exit with `Ctrl-A`, then `K`, then `Y`.

You can also use a VS Code serial monitor extension. Connect to the ST-LINK
virtual COM port with:

- Baud: `115200`
- Data bits: `8`
- Parity: `none`
- Stop bits: `1`
- Flow control: `none`

Expected output looks like:

```text
FingerFirmware 0.1.0
UART: USART2 115200 8N1
init complete i2c=0 whoami=0x00
t=1000ms loops=12345 i2c=0 whoami=0x00 accel=invalid
```

If the serial monitor opens but remains blank, reset the board after connecting
or reflash the firmware. If it is still blank, check that you selected the
ST-LINK virtual COM port and that the board routes USART2 PA2/PA3 to that port.

## VS Code

Install the recommended extensions from `.vscode/extensions.json`, then run:

```sh
./tools/setup.sh
cmake --preset nucleo-debug
```

For debugging, install
[STM32CubeCLT](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeclt.html) or
an equivalent setup that provides both `arm-none-eabi-gdb` and
`ST-LINK_gdbserver`. STM32CubeCLT includes STM32CubeProgrammer, so it is enough
for both flashing and debugging. The standalone STM32CubeProgrammer install is
only enough for flashing.

Check the debugger tools with:

```sh
./tools/check_env.sh
tools/ST-LINK_gdbserver --print-path
tools/ST-LINK_gdbserver --print-programmer-path
```

Use the **Debug NUCLEO-G431KB via ST-LINK** launch configuration to build and
debug from VS Code.

The committed VS Code configuration avoids machine-specific absolute paths. If
Cortex-Debug cannot find the ST-LINK GDB server on your machine, the
`tools/ST-LINK_gdbserver` wrapper checks common install locations. You can also
set `STLINK_GDB_SERVER=/absolute/path/to/ST-LINK_gdbserver` in your shell or VS
Code environment.

If Cortex-Debug cannot find `arm-none-eabi-gdb` or STM32CubeProgrammer after
installing your ST tools, set those paths in your VS Code user settings instead
of editing `.vscode/launch.json`.

## Useful Commands

```sh
cmake --preset nucleo-debug
cmake --build --preset nucleo-debug
cmake --build --preset nucleo-debug --target size
cmake --build --preset nucleo-debug --target flash
cmake --build --preset nucleo-debug --target erase
```

## Current Milestones

- [x] Build and flash NUCLEO-G431KB.
- [x] Blink LD2 on PB8.
- [x] Add UART logging.
- [x] Bring up I2C sensor bus.
- [ ] Test setup.sh scripts on new machines
- [ ] Bring up SAI/TDM audio capture
- [ ] Look into DMA for audio
- [ ] Look into if we want a HAL or not (CubeMX `.ioc` for final STM32G431KBU6 pinout?)
- [ ] Bring up FDCAN loopback and external CAN transceiver.
- [ ] Add CI with GitHub Actions.

## Notes For New Contributors

Start in `core/main.c`, then read `app/app.c`.

Application code should live in `app/`, `comms/`, and `sensors/`. Keep chip startup and board-specific setup small and isolated so future CubeMX-generated code can replace it cleanly.
